# Battl1v1

/////////////DISCLAIMER//////////////

This little "Game" is just a Beta and is not 100% guranteed to be updated, 
ill just work on it if ill have the mood.

The downloads on the GitHub Page has the .pde of the Game which you can open with the 
"Processing" shortcut Processing is NOT my Program (obv.) but is an IDE by another Company, 
ill just put it in here too so extra downloads arent needed.

///////////GAME DESCRIPTION//////////

This is nothing much currently.
Kinda messy code cause im still a student that is learning from 0
the basics and that for a few months through school once a week lol.

So this game is just 2 squares which are Controlled by WASD and
8456 (WASD Layout on Numpad), you can just move them around.
Also you cant get really out of bounds by just touching the walls,
itll just knoch you back to the other side youre going in.
